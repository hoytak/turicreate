/**

/**
 * This implements a user mode page fault handler.
 *
 * The basic mechanics of operation are not very complicated.
 * We first install a segfault_handler.
 *
 * When you ask for some memory, we use mmap to allocate a region, but set
 * memory protection on it to PROT_NONE (disable both read and writes to the
 * region). This way, every memory access to the region will trigger a segfault.
 *
 * When the memory is accessed, the segfault handler (segv_handler()) is
 * triggered, and try to fill in the data in the page.
 * To do so, (fill_pages()) we set the protection on the page to
 * PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE (enable read + write), call a callback function to
 * fill in the data, then sets the protection on the page to PROT_READ. Then we
 * return from the segfault handler which allows the program to resume
 * execution correctly (but cannot write to the memory, only read).
 *
 * We keep a queue of pages we have committed (add_to_access_queue()). and when
 * the queue size becomes too large, we start evicting/decommitting pages
 * (handle_eviction()). Essentially we are doing FIFO caching.  To "evict"
 * a set of pages simply involves calling madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) on the pages.
 *
 * A bunch of additional maintenance stuff are needed:
 *  - a queue of committed pages (used to manage eviction)
 *  - The set of all regions (page_sets) allocated, sorted by address
 *    to permit fast binary searches).  this is used to figure out the mapping
 *    between address and callback.
 *
 * One key design consideration is the careful use of mmap. The way the
 * procedure is defined above only calls mmap once for the entire region.
 * decommitting and committing memory is done by use of memory protection
 * and madvise. Alternate implementation built entirely around mmap is possible
 * where we use completely unallocated memory addresses, and use mmap to map
 * the pages in as required. But this requires a large number of calls to mmap,
 * which uses up a lot of kernel datastructures, which will cause mmap to fail
 * with ENOMEM after a while.
 *
 * Also, with regards to parallelism, the kernel API does not quite provide
 * sufficient capability to handle parallel accesses correctly. What is missing
 * is an atomic "fill and enable page read/write" function. Essentially, while
 * the callback function is filling in the pages for a particular memory address,
 * some other thread can read from the same memory addresses and get erroneous
 * values. mremap could in theory be used to enable this by having the callback
 * fill to alternate pages, and using mremap to atomically swap those pages in.
 * However, see the design consideration above regarding excessive use of mmap.
 * Also, mremap is not available on OS X.

 *                      char* address,
 *                      size_t fill_length) {
 *   // MUST fill in the contents of address to address + fill_length
 *   // most not write out of the bounds of [address, address+fill_length)
 *   // for instance, to fill in the array such that
 *   // arr = (size_t*)(ps->begin)
 *   // arr[i] == i

 *
 *    size_t* root = (size_t*) ps->begin;
 *    size_t* s_addr  = (size_t*) page_address;

 *

 * size_t release_callback(userpf_page_set* ps) {

 *                         released, i.e. release(pf) is called.

 *                 will handle paging.
 * The returned object MUST NOT be freed or deallocated. use \ref release.
